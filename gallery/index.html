<h1><b>Black Goose Bistro Gallery</b></h1>
<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>
<p><a href="bread.html"><img src="thumbnails/bread-200.jpg" alt="close-up of sliced rustic bread"></a><br>
We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>
<p><a href="burgers.html"><img src="thumbnails/burgers-200.jpg" alt="close-up of small sliders"></a><br>
People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>
	
<h2>Deep fried Chimpkins</h2>
<p><a href="chicken.html"><img src="thumbnails/chicken-200.jpg" alt="have a chimpkin"></a><br>
Our famous chefs have prepared our freshest fried chicken and our award winning chicken. we call them "chimpkins" because this is the most organic meat in the restaurant and couldn't figure out what to call this creature.</p>
	
<h2>Lorem Ipsum Fries</h2>
<p><a href="fries.html"><img src="thumbnails/fries-200.jpg" alt="close-up of fries"></a><br>
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Varius duis at consectetur lorem donec massa.</p>

<h2>Questionable Taboulah</h2>
<p><a href="tabouleh.html"><img src="thumbnails/tabouleh-200.jpg" alt="mysterious tabouleh"></a><br>
What is this dish you ask? This mysterious dish came from a Scandinavian folklore that could give a person super human strength or causing havoc towards your bowels. No one knows how this dish came to be on our menu and highly advised to eat it with a glass of whole milk to negate any adverse effects.</p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>
<p><a href="fish.html"><img src="thumbnails/fish-200.jpg" alt="close-up of fish ton top of potatoes"></a><br>
Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>
