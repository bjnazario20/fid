<h2>Low and Slow</h2>

<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In <dfn>sous vide</dfn> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low temperature poaching.</q>  
	</p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="20161130">November 30.</time>
